# garbage-network-scanner
(garbage) network scanner I developed and improved upon during an Ethical Hacking course :)
# Usage
To run the program, open up your terminal, cd into the directory you downloaded the scanner, and run the following command:
```
python3 netw-scanner.py <IP address you want to scan>
```
